1) build blockchain
    - blockchain

    - block
    - utxo models

2) build miner node
    - object with mempool
    - can access the blockchain's difficulty
    - creates block from 
    - can propogate messages to other nodes


- added dynamic difficulty based on average block production time (adjusts difficulty based on avg throughput)
